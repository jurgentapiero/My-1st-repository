# My-1st-repository
Hi, this is my first repository, here I will show you the solution of the challenge #2 proposed by the teacher Felipe Gonzales. I won't be working on my personal computer, and that's why the user's name is Paola, not being more let's start: 

In this challenge the professor shows us the interpreter that we are going to use, which is Python, we will use a version 3.6 or higher, in my case I have version 3.10.10. 

To verify that the installation has been correct, we will run the windows console (win + r and then type cmd + enter) and then enter the command: 

Python   --version 

We should get something like this:

After reviewing the interpreter we check that we have installed the Vs code which is going to be our editor along with the Windows Notepad, in this case the teacher recommends us to install the following Vs code extensions: 

•	Better Comments  

•	HTML Preview

•	Python IntelliSense

•	Pylance

•	Jupyter, Jupyter Cell Tags, Jupyter Slide Show 

•	C/C++, Extension Pack, Themes, Compile Run 

We will also use a control system called Git with which we can review our code (to see more information you can visit the repository of Professor Felipe: https://github.com/fegonzalez7/pdc_unal_clase2)   

Now the challenge number 2 consists of executing the following code:

In:

•	Windows Notepad preferably and run it in the terminal.

•	Directly in the Python interpreter.

•	In VSCode.

And then create this repository!!!  

1- So.... first of all we will start by copying the code of the challenge in the Windows Notepad, like this:

And we save it as a ".py" file, this is to save scripts or other files associated with programs that have been coded in the Python programming language, in my case I saved it as "greet.py" in the documents folder (important to note the folder where it was saved). 

We look for the file in the folder where we saved it and it should look like this:

After this step we right click outside the icons to open the "Git Bach Here", it should look something like this:

Once we are in the Git controller, we proceed to verify the code by typing: 

Python + the file name with its ".py" ending. 

It should run smoothly and should look like this:

As we can see the code was executed correctly and we can see the greeting: "Hello World", in case the code does not work optimally, please review the previous points, look for help on the internet or reboot your device. 

2- Now we proceed to execute the code in the Python interpreter.  

For this we will start the Windows interpreter, as explained at the beginning of this repository: "running the windows console (win + r and then type cmd + enter)" and open Python, we should get something like this: 

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J7ffw2Cf/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/mhSXCVDj)

After opening Python we copy the code we are working with and press enter twice in order to execute the code, showing us the greeting like this: 

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/R0pYgPTb/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/hJxMj169)

As we can see, the code was executed correctly in the Python interpreter. 

3- Finally we will execute the code in Vs code, for this we open the Vs code previously installed and go to the section called "New File" choose the option Python File and create a folder, in my case I will continue using the name "greet.py" important to add the extension ".py" to continue working in Python, this folder save it in the desktop and it should come out like this: 

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/prz1XPMg/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/gLcKgFJD)

Immediately the Vs code will be executed which appears with the name of the folder and we write our code, like this: 

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zXwPsDjh/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/D8ZgsTRf)

Finally we proceed to run the code in Vs code to see if it works, if it does not work it may be that the extensions recommended by the teacher have not been installed, if it does work we should get something like this when running it in the Python terminal: 

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8zKwG7r7/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/PCD1zryH)

This is how we finish challenge number two, showing the step by step of how to execute our code in these three different programs and how to use them in a basic way. 

Thank you for your attention, I hope everything is clear, blessings :*
